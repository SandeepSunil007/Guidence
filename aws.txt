
   *************** AWS ***************
 WHAT ?

 --> Amazon web service. It's a cloudInfraStructure.       we can host our application.
 --> In 2006, AWS started to offer IT services to      the market in the form of "web services".
     now a days known as "Cloud Computing".
 --> Storing the data & accessing the data from 
     internet. It doesn't store any data in HardDisk      in our personal laptop.
 --> we can access the data from remote server.

 WHY ?

 --> If i want to host my application. I need to buy      the server and along with database also need to      configuration(infrastructure setup).
  2 senarios :
     1. may be users stopping to use our application
        but, we should pay the for the hosting.
     2. may be users are incresing to use, at that         time need to buy new or increase the memory         size.

   To avoid this problem :

  AWS offer you to create a virtual machine. inside   that add a server , database and related things.
  we can specifies the instances and memory.
  Rest of the configuration take care of AWS.

 
 * In AWS, The virtual machine called 'EC2' instance
   EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud.
